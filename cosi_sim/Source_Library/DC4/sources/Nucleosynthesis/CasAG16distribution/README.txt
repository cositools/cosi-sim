# Extra data challenge exploring NuSTAR-observed 
# range of Doppler red- and blue-shifts condensed
# into a single point-like source

# Bulk centre of motion
# is not at rest. 
# Extremely minimal Doppler broadening of ~250 km/s. 
# This data challenge is more focussed on exploring
# the range of Doppler shifts we can measure with 
# the current response files. 

# There are 11 clumps in total with varying fluxes
# 10 redshifted, 1 blueshifted

# The expectation is that at least 3 spectral peaks 
# will be identifiable in the data
