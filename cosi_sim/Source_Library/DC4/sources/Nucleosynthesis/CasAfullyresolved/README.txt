# FR: Fully Resolved
# PR: Partially Resolved
# UR: Unresolved
# SYM: Symmetric
# In all 4 scenarios, bulk centre of motion
# is at rest. 
# Doppler broadening is limited to 1000 km/s
# as otherwise, when combined with the Doppler 
# shifts, the signal will fall quite outside
# the DC2 simulated response region of 1143-
# 1171 keV. 

# FR: 2x asymmetry in Doppler shifts
